			<span style="color: green; font-weight:bold">Morning has broken like the first morning Blackbird has spoken like the first bird </span><br>
			<span style="color: blue; font-weight:bold">Praise for the singing, praise for the morning Praise for them springing fresh from the world </span><br>
			<span style="color: #594c26; font-weight:bold">Sweet the rains new fall, sunlit from Heaven Like the first dewfall on the first grass </span><br>
			<span style="color: green; font-weight:bold">Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden Sprung in completeness where His feet pass </span><br>
			<span style="color: blue; font-weight:bold">Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning Born of the one light, Eden saw play </span><br>
			<span style="color: #594c26; font-weight:bold">Praise with elation, praise every morning God's recreation of the new day </span><br>
			<span style="color: green; font-weight:bold">Morning has broken like the first morning Blackbird has spoken like the first bird </span><br>
			<span style="color: blue; font-weight:bold">Praise for the singing, praise for the morning Praise for them springing fresh from the world
